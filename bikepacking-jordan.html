                <p>Turkmenistan. Quite possibly the oddest place on earth.</p>

                <p>But Turkmenistan itself is only half the adventure. Before you can explore some of the mind-blowing oddities it has to offer, you need to get there. </p>
                <p>For us, this adventure all began rather abruptly at 10pm, some 700km away in the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi where we had come to the sudden sinking realization that the Turkmen embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan, where we needed to pick up our Visas was only open one day a week until 3pm or so – the very next day. </p>
                <p>Suddenly the nice night of sleep we had been looking forwards to in our questionable hostel beds evaporated as we faced the prospect of a mad dash through the night. We hauled ourselves back out of bed, jammed our gear back into our car, and sped off into the night</p>

                <p>Our plans of a record breaking dash across the Caucasus were unfortunately dashed in short order as we pulled up to the Azerbaijani border. Laid out before us was a seemingly endless line of cars snaking off into the night. </p>
                <p>People milled here and there in groups talking and eating, or taking a stroll up and down the queue. This was clearly a normal happening. All we could do was hope the line would move quickly. </p>
                <p>The hours ticked by and we tried to catch a few winks of sleep as we melted in our stifling hot car. Every so often the line would come to life, and everyone would roll forwards a bit more. We quickly discovered that missing the line moving was a costly mistake to make as we approached a car that was not moving. Passed out in the front seat, the driver snored away as everyone rolled past. No one waited. </p>
                <p>Some time around dawn, we finally cleared the border and headed off in desperate pursuit of our much needed visas. Well aware of the stories we’d heard of encounters with Azerbaijani police, we did our best to make good time across the country. </p>
                <p>Miraculously our drive went off without a hitch, and come early afternoon we rolled up outside the Turkmen embassy, only to be greeted by a line of other travellers. </p>
                <p>Quick enquiries determined that yes, the visas were being issued, and yes, the line was actually moving. We also discovered that they did not accept cash as payment. Or card. It turned out they only accepted proof of a bank transfer from a bank “around the corner that closes soon”. So of we headed, with vague directions and a ticking clock once more. </p>
                <p>A short adventure later and we found ourselves once again at the end of the queue, watching the hours tick by. </p>

                <p>The monotony was only broken once when ambassador(?) from a nearby embassy showed up and unhappily discovered that someone had parked their car in front of his garage. To our delight (and his dismay) it transpired that the owners of the car had gotten hungry waiting in line for their Visas and had wandered off in search of food. </p>
                <p>Now as any reasonable and thoroughly bored group of people would do, we set about sorting how to get the car moved before we faced a full-blown meltdown from the very grumpy man. The solution? Pick it up. And that’s exactly what we did. In a spectacle fully worthy of Mr. Bean, the car was picked and marched down the street to somewhere it could inconvenience someone else. </p> 
                <p>At long last we made it inside the embassy, met the friendly ambassador, and left shortly after with our 5 day transit visa set to begin a couple days later. Enough time for us to catch the ferry across the Caspian Sea we had heard rumours was leaving the next day. </p>
                <p>Our marathon complete, we set off in search of the ferry terminal. </p>
                <p>Little did we know the agony was only just beginning. </p>
